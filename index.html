<div style="background-color: white">MEver go to a music store and try and pick out a guitar without your own rig? It can be very difficult. Now with Born's new Demo program we'll ship a brand new Born Guitar to your front door so you can test it out for a couple weeks through your very own rig. If you love it, keep it! If you don't just send it back. If you like it, but want to change a feature, then have us build one just for you. All you have to do is pay shipping, and best of all is the shipping (one-way) is credited towards your next purchase with Born Guitars. You got nothin' to lose!</div>
